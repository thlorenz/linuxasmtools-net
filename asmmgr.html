NAME<br>
<br>
 asmmgr - file manager for assembler programmers<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
 AsmMgr is an assembler IDE front end. It calls several<br>
 support programs and can coordinate development. The<br>
 design and key usage is similar to the mc file manager.<br>
<br>
 When configured for assembler development the top row<br>
 of buttons provide compile and debug buttons. The<br>
 "project" button will list installed tools, create<br>
 project directories, open projects, build makefiles,<br>
 build sample source files, and assist with setting<br>
 up projects. <br>
<br>
 AsmMgr was written to ease assembly development and<br>
 remove some of the hurdles faced by novice programmers.<br>
<br>
 AsmMgr is part of a collection of programs that can work<br>
 together or work as stand alone functions. These programs<br>
 are:<br>
  asmbug  - debugger<br>
  asmsrc  - source code generator<br>
  asmdis  - disassembler<br>
  asmedit - editor<br>
  asmlib -  library<br>
  asmplan - todo list (design functions planned)<br>
  asmref  - extensive help system<br>
  asmfunc - helper programs for asmedit, asmmgr, and others<br>
  asmmgr - front end<br>
  asmpub - builds documents from comments in source (in design)<br>
  asmsrc - generates nasm source from ELF executable<br>
<br>
STARTUP WINDOW<br>
<br>
 The middle buttons are file related and work on the highlighted file.<br>
 For move or copy operations the highlighted file/directory is moved to<br>
 directory shown in opposing panel.<br>
<br>
 The bottom line is always available for shell commands.<br>
<br>
 the top row of buttons are user defined. The defaults are<br>
 setup to create an ide for assembler. All top buttons are<br>
 attached to external programs or scripts.<br>
<br>
USAGE<br>
<br>
 When first loaded, AsmMgr looks for paths on the command<br>
 line and if not found it used the $HOME directory.<br>
 AsmMgr can accept paths for the two windows.<br>
<br>
 Another somewhat invisible input is from a collection of<br>
 files that configure the program and control how it reacts<br>
 to user input. These files can describe projects, buttons,<br>
 button actions, and other parameters.<br>
<br>
QUICK START<br>
<br>
 To quickly set up an assembler project, simply click the<br>
 project button and fill out the form. Then select open<br>
 project from within the project setup dialog. The new<br>
 project will appear in the left panel. Click the "make"<br>
 button to compile the sample source file and click the<br>
 "debug" button to enter the debugger.<br>
<br>
MOUSE<br>
<br>
 The mouse is active in all windows (if AsmMgr is executed in<br>
 an xterm). In console mode, the keyboard is used. In most<br>
 menu's the up/down arrow keys followed by enter, will select<br>
 options. Escape or ctrl-O can be used to exit most windows.<br>
<br>
 Mouse Usage<br>
<br>
 All buttons can be selected by mouse clicks. The right/left<br>
 panels can be activated by mouse clicks and once selected<br>
 individual files can be highlighted.<br>
<br>
 Clicking a highlighed entry will result in an action<br>
 AsmMgr thinks is appropiate. If executable is found, it<br>
 will be started, if directory it will be entered, etc.<br>
<br>
 Right clicks on top button row will convert button into<br>
 a bookmark using currently active directory.<br>
<br>
 Top button bar<br>
<br>
 The top buttons can be configured with "setup" as either<br>
 functions or bookmarks. A bookmark label has to start<br>
 with the "/" character and functions can be any executable.<br>
 All top buttons result in execution of a shell command.<br>
<br>
 Since some of the buttons call scripts it is easy to change<br>
 the way they operate. Each top button executable receives<br>
 the selected right/left window entries as parameters.<br>
<br>
 Bookmark buttons have a short cut feature that sets the<br>
 current directory to bookmark. Simply right-click on<br>
 a top line button and it becomes a bookmark.<br>
<br>
 vertical button bar<br>
<br>
 The status button brings up a table showing the<br>
 status of current highlighted entry. It also allows<br>
 attributes and owners to be changed.<br>
<br>
 The open button works on highlighted entry. If a<br>
 directory is highlighted, it is entered. If a file<br>
 is highlighted it is decoded using a table of<br>
 instructions (see setup function to edit table).<br>
 If the file is an executable it will be executed.<br>
<br>
 the view button works on highlighted entry. It<br>
 will try to determine viewing options using a<br>
 table of instructions. (see setup button to<br>
 edit table).<br>
<br>
 The edit button starts an editor on the currently<br>
 highlighted file. The default editor can be selected<br>
 from the setup button.<br>
<br>
 Copy transfers files/directories from on panel to<br>
 the other. An option to change names occurs before<br>
 the copy.<br>
<br>
 Move will move files and directories and rename<br>
 them. To rename anything set both panels to the<br>
 same location an use move with name change.<br>
<br>
 Delete is a very dangerous button. Beware, it does<br>
 not ask first.<br>
<br>
 Expand knows about most compression types and expands<br>
 them.<br>
<br>
 Tar.gz makes compressed files in only one format. <br>
<br>
 Compare will compare the two text files in right<br>
 and left panels. It uses an external program to<br>
 do this which can be changed by editing the compare<br>
 script. Initially AsmMgr expects the program<br>
 xxdiff to be available and does nothing if not found.<br>
<br>
 Print needs to be setup for your printer. It is<br>
 currently setup for a deskjet 500 which may not<br>
 be ideal. The print script can be edited to<br>
 change its operation.<br>
<br>
 The terminal button can be used to check on the results<br>
 of AsmMgr shell commands or work in the shell. Once in<br>
 the shell it is necessary to type "exit" to leave.<br>
<br>
 Another way to enter and leave the terminal is with the<br>
 ctrl-o key. This is easy to remember since it is used<br>
 to exit many commands that call terminal programs.<br>
<br>
 The terminal entry line accepts all alpha characters typed.<br>
 Pressing &lt;return&gt; will execute the line. Note: if no<br>
 characters have been typed, the &lt;return&gt; key is connected<br>
 to the open button.<br>
<br>
 The highlighted file can be inserted into a terminal command<br>
 by entering "%f". For example: to edit the current file with<br>
 vi type:<br>
  <br>
     vi %f &lt;enter&gt;<br>
<br>
 Note: Since typing &lt;Enter&gt; can execute a highlighted program<br>
 or run data on the terminal it is necessary to keep AsmMgr<br>
 informed about which is needed. To help with this the terminal<br>
 line is highlighted whenever AsmMgr thinks it is being used<br>
 to enter commands. To get out of the entry mode, type ESC or<br>
 any non-alpha key.<br>
<br>
Keyboard commands<br>
<br>
  ctrl-x      -  exit<br>
  alt-x       -  exit<br>
  alt-q       -  exit<br>
<br>
  tab    - switch panels<br>
<br>
  ctrl-o - switch to and from the terminal display<br>
<br>
  right/left<br>
  arrow keys - traverse directory tree<br>
<br>
  up/down<br>
  arrow keys - traverse up/down file list<br>
<br>
  pgup/pgdn  - page up down file selection panel<br>
<br>
  enter - same as open button<br>
<br>
  ESC,q,ctrl-o are all used to exit helper programs<br>
  run by asmmgr. A few helper programs require other<br>
  keys to exit and for these programs ctrl-c always<br>
  works. For example the "less" viewer is run when<br>
  the F3 key is pressed. Normally, "less" uses the<br>
  'q' key to exit. Asmmgr also recognizes ESC, F3,<br>
  and ctrl-c as exit keys.<br>
<br>
  all other keys are show on buttons and usage is<br>
  obvious.<br>
<br>
INSTALL<br>
<br>
  The command "make install" as root can be used to<br>
  install AsmMgr. Program can be uninstalled with<br>
  "make uninstall".<br>
<br>
Configuration<br>
<br>
  The "setup" button can be used to edit the<br>
  configuration files and change AsmMgr operation.<br>
  <br>
  Access button  file name        Description<br>
  -------------  --------------   ------------------------<br>
  setup          config.tbl       general settings<br>
  setup          top_buttons.tbl  defines buttons on top row<br>
  setup          open_button.tbl  defines open button action<br>
  setup          view_button.tbl  defines view button action<br>
  project        project.tbl      describes projects<br>
<br>
  The top row buttons can also be bookmarks which are<br>
  set from the "setup" button or right click.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEPENDENCIES<br>
<br>
  Optional compile dependency: AsmLib<br>
<br>
  AsmMgr calls numerous UNIX utilities, too many<br>
  for a short list.  If a feature does not work or<br>
  a file type will can not be viewed, then install<br>
  the program that can not be found.  Normally, the<br>
  most used programs are already installed.<br>
