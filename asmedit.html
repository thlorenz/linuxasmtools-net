NAME<br>
 asmedit - text editor enhanced for assembler development<br>
<br>
SYNOPSIS<br>
 asmedit &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;<br>
 Starting with no parameters. Without parameters AsmEdit looks for<br>
 the history file and uses it to load the last active edit file.<br>
 If a file has been deleted the edit session starts with an<br>
 un-named file.<br>
 Starting with one file. With one file the editor begins with<br>
 a single window and whatever starting mode has been setup.<br>
 Starting with two files brings up the first file in a single<br>
 window. Typing "w" or "o" shows the other file.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
 AsmEdit is based on an editor developed at Intel around 1983.<br>
 The current version has some enhancements, including a<br>
 help facility, mouse menus, and improved windowing.<br>
 Feature Summary- small executable size<br>
                  mouse or keyboard controls<br>
                  edits anything that will fit in memory<br>
                  dual window modes<br>
                  highlights assembly language comments<br>
                  compiles and shows errors<br>
                  simple calculator<br>
                  macros<br>
                  optional helper programs, spelling, etc.<br>
                  paragraphing<br>
                  hex input and character display<br>
                  <br>
 The editor can be used in the full screen edit mode but<br>
 is more useful if the "command" mode is utilized. Basically,<br>
 the editor has two modes. In the command mode most of the<br>
 alpha keys become commands. The "f" key becomes find and<br>
 the "c" key becomes "calc". Additionally, upper case keys<br>
 trigger menus while in command mode. Text entry begins<br>
 by entering the edit mode (full screen edit).<br>
 The "command" mode is triggered by the ESC key and "edit"<br>
 mode can be triggered by the key "i" for insert and<br>
 "x" for overtype. <br>
 To get started in "command" mode a series of menus can be<br>
 activated by pressing the "space" bar or any command using<br>
 upper case letters. Additionally, any mouse operation<br>
 triggers the menus. <br>
 The next few sections focus on the basic keyboard commands<br>
 and assume the mouse along with its menus can explain themselves.<br>
<br>
USAGE<br>
 AsmEdit can be used as a IDE (Integrated Development Environment)<br>
 for writing assembler programs. If the edit file ends with<br>
 .asm, .s, or .inc it will trigger some basic syntax highlighting.<br>
 The function keys launch compile and debug programs. Sample,<br>
 scripts are provided and anyone familiar will shell scripts can<br>
 customize the IDE functions.<br>
 See sections 5 and 6 for function key setup.<br>
 Like other text editors AsmEdit can be used for general purpose<br>
 edit functions. It does not impose any format on files and<br>
 has been used to modify binary files. The paragraph function<br>
 makes it useful for creating ascii text and it easily connects<br>
 to spell checkers (see section 5). The macro command allows<br>
 minimal text formatting and calc sometimes helps with programming.<br>

                        space - main menu<br>
                       F1 - help<br>
                       F2 - project planner<br>
                       F3 - compile (a.f3 user defined)<br>
                       F4 - debug (a.f4 user defined)<br>
  tab other window     F5 - spell (a.f5 user defined)<br>
  -   find reverse     F6 - compare (a.f6 user defined)<br>
  ^a  delete right     F7 - print (a.f7 user defined)<br>
  ^x  delete left      F8 - calls user file a.f8<br>
  ^z  delete line      F9 - calls user file a.f9<br>
  ^u  restore line     F10 - quick exit<br>
  ^r  enter hex char   F11 - calls user file a.f11<br>
 <br>
  Mouse controls<br>
<br>
 The mouse operates as follows:<br>
   * click in window moves the cursor<br>
   * click selects any window it occurs in.<br>
   * click on "buttons" select and execute actions.<br>
   * right click will inspect data at cursor and launch<br>
     browser or email client or ask for input.<br>
 All left click mouse activity triggers menus.<br>
 To bring up the mouse menus any upper case command can be<br>
 used. Commands are indicated on menus by an appropriate<br>
 upper case character. Additionally, pressing space bar<br>
 while in command mode will trigger the menus.<br>
 <br>
    Keyboard commands<br>
<br>
 The keyboard is completely redefined for each mode. Since<br>
 AsmEdit only has two basic modes (command and edit) this doesn't<br>
 cause much confusion. In Edit mode the expected alpha keys<br>
 enter text and the control/function keys deal with cursor movement<br>
 and other functions. The "command" mode uses the alpha keys for<br>
 commands and minimizes finger movement (not much ctrl, meta key<br>
 or multiple key pressing).<br>
 The rest of this section describes the keys used in "command"<br>
 mode.<br>
   <br>
    keys associated with File operations<br>
<br>
 AsmEdit works with two files and a buffer. If additional files<br>
 are needed they can be loaded but only two files are active<br>
 at one time. The program can start with zero, one, or two<br>
 files. If file names are not provided the program still<br>
 allows work to proceed on two unnamed files. Since the<br>
 program always tries to load the last file accessed it seldom<br>
 starts with zero files.<br>
 The "q" key begins a two key command. The second key is<br>
 prompted for but most users just ignore the dialog and<br>
 press two keys quickly in session. The key pairs that<br>
 work with "q" are:<br>
 q a - abort all files without saving or asking any questions.<br>
 q e - save all modified files and exit, ask for names in unnamed.<br>
 q i - save active file and load (initialize) new file<br>
 q u - save copy of active file (update) and continue editing<br>
 q w - change name of active file and write it out. Then<br>
      continue editing without modifying the original file<br>
      F10 is an alternative command to quit and avoids the<br>
      above menus.<br>
 The buffer is explained in section 4.3 (Working with blocks<br>
 of text). This includes inserting files and moving blocks<br>
 of text around.<br>
<br>
 Three window arrangements are available. They are: single<br>
 split horizontal, and split vertical.<br>
 w - toggles between three window styles.<br>
 o - stays in current window style and shows "other" file.<br>
     Pressing "o" again, toggles back to original file.<br>
 <br>
    Cursor Movement and text editing<br>
<br>
 Cursor keys are available in both the "edit" and "command" mode.<br>
 They include the usual: pgdn, pgup, up, down, home, end, Ins,<br>
 Del, right, left, and Backspace keys.<br>
 t - opens up a dialog to set tags a,b,c,d<br>
     Normally, one just types "ta" and ignores the<br>
     dialog.<br>
 j - opens up the jump dialog with these options:<br>
     l - jump to line number<br>
     s - jump to start of file<br>
     e - jump to end of file<br>
     a - jump to tag a<br>
     b - jump to tag b<br>
     c - jump to tag c<br>
     d - jump to tag d<br>
     <br>
  The following keys assist with editing text and selecting<br>
  edit modes<br>
 i - enter the "insert" edit mode and leaves command mode<br>
 x - enter the "overtype" edit mode and leaves command mode<br>
 ^a - (ctrl & a) delete line characters to right of cursor<br>
 ^x - (ctrl & x) delete line characters to left of cursor<br>
 ^z - (ctrl & z) delete a line<br>
 ^u - restore a deleted line, (can restore same line over and over)<br>
 ^r - enter hex character. This works in all modes and when<br>
      entering search strings. Each hex character is expected to<br>
      be two characters long. Thus entering zero would require<br>
      "00" entry.<br>
      note: The ^ indicates "Ctrl" key is held down.<br>
  <br>
    Blocks and Finding/Replacing text<br>
<br>
 f - find text. The text string is terminated by typing<br>
     ESC. Strings can contain CR (carriage returns) and<br>
     LF (line feed) characters) along with other hex characters.<br>
 - - The "-" key is used to find text above the cursor.<br>
 r - find and replace. This command includes some query features<br>
     and will prompt for multiple replaces.<br>
 a - again. repeats the last find operation or macro.<br>
     <br>
  Keys associated with buffers and blocks of text.<br>
 b - begin block at current cursor position. Typing "b" again<br>
     ends the block and puts a copy in the buffer. If the "d"<br>
     is pressed to end a block the text is deleted and placed<br>
     in the buffer.<br>
 d - same as "b" but used to cut a block out and move it to the<br>
     buffer.<br>
 g - inserts the buffer at cursor or inserts a file a cursor. To<br>
     insert buffer type "gb" to insert file type "gf". Typing<br>
     "g" followed by enter will default to "gb" and get the<br>
     the buffer.<br>
     note:  The b,d,g commands are used to move blocks of text<br>
            within a file and between files. The buffer holds<br>
            only one block and it remains in the buffer when<br>
            new files are loaded or until a new block is placed<br>
            in the buffer.<br>
     note:  The "gf" command will pop up a file selector if it is<br>
            installed.<br>
            <br>
    Misc. functions<br>
<br>
 c - starts a simple calculator on he status line<br>
       examples:  1+2 &lt;enter&gt;<br>
                  -1+2 &lt;enter&gt;<br>
                  fffffff1h &lt;enter&gt;<br>
                  -1 &lt;enter&gt;<br>
                  abch + 3 &lt;enter&gt;<br>
 p - displays paragraph prompt. Text at the cursor can be<br>
     paragraphed or margins set. The macro command can be<br>
     used to repeat paragraphing and do a whole document.<br>
     Paragraphs are defined as staring by two carriage returns<br>
     and terminated by two carriage returns. It the cursor is<br>
     anywhere inside a paragraph the program search both directions<br>
     for pairs of carriage returns and this defines the area that<br>
     will be processed.<br>
 m - begin macro definition. Pressing "m" again in command mode<br>
     ends the macro. Status line is colored red while macro mode<br>
     is active.<br>
 e - executes a defined macro.<br>
 a - repeats execution<br>
 s - setup is launched.<br>
 F1 - help<br>
 F2 - launch project planner<br>
 <br>
 note: the remaining function keys are user defined, see<br>
       next section.<br>
<br>
   User defined functions (function keys, help)<br>
<br>
 The function key menu does not appear on the main menu<br>
 because it is user defined and difficult to document in<br>
 advance. A menu can be found by pressing the space bar<br>
 twice while in "command" mode. This is hidden and describes<br>
 the default/authors configuration.<br>
<br>
 F3 - The F3 key is designed for running a make file or compiler.<br>
      It calls a user defined scrip named a.f3 and provides the<br>
      edit file as parameter 1 ($1 if in script). The script is<br>
      expected to write its results (compile errors) to a file<br>
      named "tmp.2". This file is read when script completes<br>
      and placed in a window next to the source code.<br>
      A side effect of F3 is an automatic update of the source<br>
      file (file1) if it has changed.<br>
      The sample a.f3 script calls "make" and is installed<br>
      at $HOME/.asmide/edit/a.f3. A custom script called a.f3 can be<br>
      placed in the working directory and it will be executed<br>
      instead of the one at $HOME/.asmide/edit. This allows special<br>
      handling of compiles.<br>
      <br>
 F4 - The F4 key is setup for running a debugger. It passes the<br>
      current file with tail stripped off. if the file was called<br>
      file.asm the .asm will be stripped and only "file" passed.<br>
      No data is read back from the debugger.<br>
      If many files are edited and then combined into one executable<br>
      a local copy of the a.f4 script can be created to always<br>
      debug the master file. AsmEdit will look for helper programs in<br>
      the local directory first, then look in $HOME/.asmide/edit/ and finally<br>
      the path will be searched. The local copy of a.f4 could be<br>
      written as:  #! /bin/bash<br>
                   kdbg my_program<br>
 F5-F9 are user defined and call scripts a.f5 through a.f9. Each<br>
      script is passed a copy of the edit file and when done the<br>
      program reads the edit file back. This allows spell checkers<br>
      to make modifications. It is assumed that print programs and<br>
      others will not modify the file.<br>
      If the program is working with two files then two parameters<br>
      will be passed to the called script. This allows compare<br>
      programs to be implemented.<br>
      See example scripts and make files for more information.<br>
 The help command text can be changed by editing file a.hlp<br>
 which is kept with the executable.<br>
 The cursor keys work in help mode along with the "f" find<br>
 command. The easiest way to get around is with a mouse. Menu<br>
 items  exist for the major sections.<br>
HISTORY AND THEORY<br>
  This projects began as an attempt to port a large<br>
  collection of DOS programs/libraries to Linux.<br>
  When it became clear that existing assembler tools<br>
  were not comfortable, work began on a rough IDE. A<br>
  few months later a version of nasm with symbolic<br>
  information was discovered and the kdbg debugger<br>
  became available. kdbg allowed debugging to occur<br>
  while viewing the source file, and setting breakpoints<br>
  was reduced to a single mouse click. This combination<br>
  make debugging assembler programs much easier.<br>
  The best part was being able to view comments in the<br>
  source file. Us old brain dead programmers need all<br>
  the help we can get and without comments we go around<br>
  in big circles.<br>
  To obtain syntax highlighting in AsmEdit the edit file<br>
  name must end with ".asm" or ".s" or ".inc". This<br>
  enables comment highlighting. For ".s" files the<br>
  comment character is "#" and for all others it is<br>
  ";". This isn't full syntax highlighting but<br>
  it does make a big difference when reading source<br>
  files.<br>
  The function key F3 is designed to compile programs<br>
  if an appropriate script (a.f3) is available. Section<br>
  11 has an example script.<br>
  The function key F4 is designed to run a debugger.<br>
  The example script in section 11 calls up kdbg.<br>
  Other function keys can be used to compare files<br>
  or do other functions. The process works like this:<br>
  Begin editing source file. Once editing starts AsmEdit<br>
  call be called without parameters and it remembers<br>
  the file and cursor position.<br>
  Create a "Makefile" to compile your program. The<br>
  F3 function can then be used to compile programs<br>
  and AsmEdit automatically places error information<br>
  in a side window.<br>
  Once the program is built the debugger can be called<br>
  with F4. At this point it is important to enable<br>
  source debugging with symbols.<br>
<br>
  In 2007 the AsmBug debugger was written and it is<br>
  now the default. Also, it was designed for assembler<br>
  work. It shows symbols and comments added to right<br>
  of instructions.<br>
<br>
  I found debuggers like the program to begin with "_start"<br>
  or "main" labels and have the labels declared global.<br>
  If the "ld" link program is used it sometimes needs a<br>
  reference to the library "ld-linux.so.2". Also, modifying<br>
  the ELF format seems to confuse some debuggers. <br>
  An example Makefile can be found in section 11<br>
<br>
    Project Planning<br>
<br>
  Function key F2 attempts to launch the "plan" program<br>
  for entering reminders and planning of tasks. The plan<br>
  program is a separate program which must be installed<br>
  if this feature is desired. It is normally included with<br>
  the editor. <br>
<br>
   Installation and file list<br>
<br>
  See file INSTALL or just type "make install" as root.<br>
  To install the AsmEdit executable manually , move it to any<br>
  directory reachable by $PATH or create a alias for the<br>
  current shell.<br>
  AsmEdit will run by itself but many of the commands will<br>
  be terse and not friendly. The AsmFunc package adds<br>
  features most users will want. It can be installed<br>
  at any time using "make install" from within its source<br>
  directory. <br>
<br>
RESTRICTIONS<br>
<br>
  AsmEdit only works on Linux x86 platforms and probably<br>
  needs a kernel of 2.4 or older.<br>
  It can edit any file that fits in memory. I've loaded<br>
  6 megabyte files and some operations are slower due<br>
  to the file size. It is better to work in smaller<br>
  pieces and merge later.<br>
  The mouse, color, fonts, and cursor movements depend upon<br>
  terminal features. They should work with all xterm<br>
  clones but the Linux console does not support the mouse.<br>
  AsmEdit is covered by the GNU license. See file COPYING<br>
  for more information.<br>
<br>
COMPILING<br>
<br>
  The compiler is compiled with the latest version<br>
  of nasm. Originally it was compiled with<br>
  nasm version 98.22, with a symbolic<br>
  debug patch applied. Patch is available from:<br>
   http://ls7-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/%7Ewawro/index.html<br>
  Older versions of nasm tend to fail.<br>
  Other versions of this editor have a "set" command to<br>
  configure the program. This version has a "s" setup<br>
  window along with tables and scripts that can be<br>
  easily modified. I'm lazy and have not implemented<br>
  the original set style command.<br>
  AsmEdit code is very easy to reconfigure<br>
  because it is driven by a set of table. The only problem<br>
  is knowing how the tables work and which ones to modify.<br>
  Here is some basic information on the tables:<br>
  Colors are kept in a series of dwords starting with<br>
  norm_text_color. The comments in source describe formats<br>
  and the color labels describe their function.<br>
  Keyboard mapping is controlled by a series of tables and<br>
  every key has a separate mapping for the two modes (command,<br>
  edit). The keystring_tbl is searched after<br>
  every key press for a match. If found the "find location"<br>
  becomes an index into another set of tables which describe<br>
  the process to call. This process is coded as a one byte<br>
  index into the final table which is a list of addresses<br>
  or processes.<br>
  This allows all the editor keys to be redefined by simply<br>
  working with tables.<br>
  The mouse is defined by another set of tables which are<br>
  used to decode clicks, associate processing with clicks,<br>
  and display buttons. These tables are defined in a<br>
  list as:<br>
  dd	m1_menu<br>
  dd	m2_quit<br>
  dd	m3_window<br>
  dd	m4_jump<br>
  dd	m5_misc<br>
  dd	m6_edit<br>
  dd	m7_find<br>
  dd	m8_block<br>
  dd	m9_function<br>
  dd	m10_help<br>
  The format of table entries:  dword(process)<br>
                                string(button text)<br>
                                string terminator(number from 1-8)<br>
  This simple format provides enough information to display<br>

  name and rewrite the button text. Oh yes, the number of<br>
  spaces between buttons is controlled by number in string<br>

    History and credits<br>
<br>
 Predecessors to AsmEdit went by various names. One was called<br>
 "Aedit" and another "Alter" along with a few other names.<br>
 The original documentation was published at Intel on <br>
 January of 1983.<br>
 First coded in the PLM language and soon ported to DOS<br>
 by wrapping the editor in a conversion layer. Eventually,<br>
 it was re-written in "c" and became mbedit. A free<br>
 copy of mbedit is available for many platforms and can<br>
 be found with a web search.<br>
