      <h2>Libraries - Who needs them<br>
      </h2>
      <hr class="content" noshade="noshade"> <br>
      <p>My system has been getting sluggish lately and the file
browser was
taking forever.&nbsp; To better understand the problem I began to check
the size of various
directories... and that is when a strange result appeared:&nbsp;&nbsp;
The following script will count files, guess<br>
what it said?<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ls -R i/usr/lib/* | wc -l</p>
      <p>One would expect to see a file count.&nbsp; What I saw was
61,112
.&nbsp; Assuming it was a mistake I tried a few other tests.&nbsp; Same
result, my system had 61,112 files in /usr/lib.&nbsp; After more&nbsp;
digging it was clear that many of these files were seldom used and some
had never been&nbsp; used. &nbsp; Well.., disk space is cheap, but ii
does make one wonder why so many library files are used.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The /usr/lib directory is suppose to&nbsp; contain either
dynamic or
static library files.&nbsp; The static files are used to build programs
at compile time and the dynamic libraries link with programs at run
time.&nbsp; I found a lot of each, but mostly they appeared to be
dynamic library&nbsp; files. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The theory is that disk space is saved by having programs
share
dynamic library files.&nbsp; The library files can be shared by many
programs and even remain in memory to save load time. Sounds good, but
the theory was did not match what I was seeing.&nbsp;
This leads to another question.&nbsp; What are the disadvantages of
dynamic libraries:&nbsp;
How about:<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;1. Dynamic libraries need to retain symbols and this
takes up
more disk space.<br>
&nbsp;2. Dynamic library linking slows down execution of programs.<br>
&nbsp;3. Each language trys to write its libraries in their own
language and there are thousands of languages.<br>
&nbsp;4. Novice users and others have problems keeping library versions
current and sometimes multiple versions of the same library are
needed.&nbsp; This is often called dependency hell.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Those problems can be bad, but they don't explain my
system.&nbsp;
I was seeing proliferation of libraries that were added just incase
they were needed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If we step back and think about this, it appears programmers
are
extending their language and programs by adding library
functions.&nbsp; Essentially, we are growing programming
universes&nbsp; via
libraries.&nbsp; Each universe continues to expand.&nbsp; We have a
Perl universe, a "C" universe, a open office universe, and so on.<br>
      </p>
      <p>All this growth is part of freedom and fits well with Linux
philosophy.&nbsp; It also is beginning to look like bloat and
confusion.&nbsp; At some point we might want to ask:&nbsp; Do dynamic
libraries have more disadvantages than advantages?&nbsp; Can we improve
all this and make Linux more efficient?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Responses to these questions seem to fall into two
camps.&nbsp;
Those that view the basic system structure as sacred and
untouchable.&nbsp; Another group that see it as too difficult too
change.&nbsp; Both views ignore the problem.&nbsp; I think we need to
take a hard look at the data and generate some solutions. <br>
      </p>
      <p>What do you think?<br>
      <br>
