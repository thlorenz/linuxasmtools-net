Why another FAQ on assembly programming?<br>
<br>
There are several FAQ's on assembly programming and each<br>
includes the opinions and views of the authors.  Hopefully,<br>
this FAQ provides a different view of assembly.<br>
<br>
Is assembler primary for optimizaton and fast graphics?<br>
<br>
No, assembler is just another language that can be used<br>
in many ways.  This site is focusing on terminal programs<br>
that perform tasks or present data.<br>
<br>
<br>
What is different about LinuxAsmTools?<br>
<br>
AsmTool programs run in a text terminal and present<br>
character based menus.  They avoid graphics   and<br>
the UNIX command line style.  This type of programming<br>
can handle many applicatons without loss of usability<br>
or friendlyness.  In most cases the code is much smaller<br>
and faster than graphical applications. Also, it is<br>
friendlier than command line applications.<br>
<br>
   <br>
Isn't it difficult to code in assembler?<br>
  <br>
Many programmers find assembly both difficult and tedious.<br>
A few find it easy and enjoyable.  Programmers are a diverse<br>
group.<br>
  <br>
Why would anyone want to code applications in assembler?<br>
<br>
Each project has different objectives and goals.  Someone<br>
wrote in a FAQ that assembler should be used for HLL optimization<br>
and not used for projects.  Statements like this assume a lot<br>
about the programmer involved and their application.  Fortunately,<br>
Linux is open system and people can make their own choice.<br>
  <br>
My personal belief is that assembler gets a lot of bad press<br>
because many people find it difficult to understand and it scares<br>
them.  On the other hand I find assembler easy and can write<br>
many utilities faster in assembler than in other languages.<br>
<br>
Is it possible for assembly coding to be easy?<br>
<br>
Most assembly programms use 8-9 simple instructions<br>
over and over.  That can be tedious but seldom difficult.<br>
The problems with assembly are elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Does assembly fit the unix and Linux enviornment?<br>
  <br>
No, assembly does not fit Linux very well.  Most of<br>
the code is in C and the documentation is written for<br>
C programmers.  The tools are not ideal for assembler<br>
and few assembly programmers exist.  This is changing<br>
and as of 2004 it is now possible to write programs<br>
without a major struggle.<br>
<br>
<br>
What are the big problems with assembly programming<br>
<br>
The biggest problem with assembly is its lack of<br>
structure.  Novice programmers quickly get into trouble<br>
and create a nightmare.  This, combined with the<br>
number of instructions needed to build a program<br>
creates much work and pain.<br>
<br>
Isn't assembly tedious?<br>
<br>
Yes and No.  If you have good libraries and tools,<br>
assembly is similiar to a HLL language. On Linux many<br>
tutorial talk about debugging with GDB and using<br>
existing libraries.  That is painful.  GDB is difficult<br>
to use and existing libraries are a poor fit for most<br>
assembly programs.  It is the intent of the AsmTools<br>
project to move Linux assembler into user friendly.<br>
<br>
Isn't assembly prone to large unmaintainable projects?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Shoud we use a standard assembly coding style?<br>
  <br>
There is a FAQ somewhere on assembly coding style.<br>
It has some good ideas but feels constricting.  Also,<br>
it misses the big issues of simplicity and structure.<br>
A terrible design or program can hide behind style.<br>
A better idea might be to focus on simplicity and<br>
a well organized program structure.  Avoid excess<br>
macros, equates, and other embelishments.  Instead<br>
focus on modular blocks and clear descriptions.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm a novice at assembly, where is the best place to begin.<br>
<br>
Assembly can be very easy to understand if one knows<br>
major blocks of a CPU and a little about hex arithmetic.<br>
The computer can be understood in about ten minutes of<br>
discussion or a basic computer book.  Hex takes a little<br>
longer to understand.  Both of these topics are essencial<br>
knowledge for other programming languages.<br>
<br>
Probably the best place to start is a beginning assembler<br>
book.  Another approach is to study the HOWTO for writing<br>
a simple program.  This is the approach I prefer and it<br>
gives a quick look at a working assembler program.<br>

<br>
Which is better ATT syntax or Intel syntax?<br>
<br>
Most code is in Intel syntax and it may be<br>
the best choice.  On the other hand, programmers<br>
may want to pick the syntax they feel comfortable<br>
with.  The GAS assembler uses both syntax forms,<br>
so it isn't a big issue for most projects.  <br>
<br>
Which is the best assembler to use?<br>
<br>
Nasm and Gas both work well.  Some reports<br>
say Fasm also works.  The newer versions of nasm<br>
now have "stabs" debugging support which is useful.<br>
Another quasi-assembler to look at is High Level<br>
Assembler or HLA.  There is also, Yasm which allows<br>
several syntax variations. They are all good assemblers.<br>
This site uses nasm.<br>
<br>
What is the best debugger to use?<br>
<br>
see the tutorial on debugging.<br>
<br>
How can I justify using assembler on my next project?<br>
<br>
Justifying assembler to others is usually a waste of<br>
time.  It is difficult to prove other langages will<br>
be significantly slower or bloated, or that assembler<br>
can be easy to work with.  Also, few people are<br>
skilled in assembler development.<br>

Novice FAQ<br>
<br>
Where is the console or X terminal?<br>
<br>
If you are using a major Linux distrubition, it will boot to
the<br>
X window system and present a launch button.&nbsp; The launch<br>
menu almost always has a terminal program on it somewhere.<br>
Typically they are called: rxvt, terminal, xterm, konsole,<br>
gnome-terminal, aterm, etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
How do I set up a terminal?<br>
<br>
Each terminal program is different, but one of the easiest is
the<br>
KDE konsole program.&nbsp; Konsole starts with a menu at the
top<br>
which allows the terminal to be configured.&nbsp; This includes
fonts,<br>
size, color, etc.<br>
<br>
Can I attach programs to an icon<br>
<br>
From within KDE, right click on an empty space within the desktop
and select :<br>
&nbsp; Create new<br>
&nbsp; Link to Application<br>
&nbsp; Application&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Command<br>
&nbsp; (enter executable name as Command)<br>
&nbsp; click on Advanced Options<br>
&nbsp; select run in&nbsp; terminal<br>
&nbsp; (click OK and return to&nbsp; first menu)<br>
&nbsp; if you want a special picture for icon, click on the
icon.<br>
