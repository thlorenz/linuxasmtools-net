      <strong></strong> <br>
For 50 years we have worked at improving the
software development process and little has changed. Why is
software development so hard?<br>
      <br>
This is the question posed by the book "Dreaming in Code"(published in
2007). The book states over 66% of all projects are either canaled or
miss their targets by a wide margin. At the same time optimistic
programmers are touting new techniques,languages, and tools that will
solve development problems.Why do these new tools and techniques have
little impact?<br>
      <br>
The book "Dreaming in Code" did not have any answers. They ended by
saying : "coding is hard". I, on the other hand, am one of those
optimistic programmers who thinks the answer is obvious. The rest of
this essay presents my case.<br>
      <br>
First, my credentials. I've worked on about a 100 projects since
1967.&nbsp; This has included large projects, small projects,
many&nbsp; failures, and a lot of successes.&nbsp; The fact that the
success have some things in
common and the
failures also share traits gives us the clues to begin our quest. We
can assume if some projects are successful then there are answers to be
found.<br>
      <br>
Postmortems of failed projects have one thing in common. Lots of
problems and over optimism. The problems range from budget
constraints,&nbsp; design errors, poor
skills, shifting requirements, and just about anything that could
possibly go wrong. The conclusion is obvious; software projects can be
complex. Thus, the answer must involve reduction and management of
complexity. Seems obvious, but tell that to all the language and tool
developers who felt they were solving the problem. Also, tell the
methodology folks and those who pushed good programming practices.<br>
      <br>
Have we focused on the wrong problems for the last 50 years? I think we
have. The answer is right in front of us and it is being ignored.<br>
      <br>
We know that the coding process is sometimes a small part of big
projects.
Successful projects almost universally recognize this fact. This gives
us
another good clue.<br>
      <br>
We also have lots of facts showing great diversity in programmer skill
levels, and adding more programmers often kills a project. We know
about
open development projects and ego-less programming.
We also know about modular programming and splitting a project into
definable tasks.<br>
      <br>
Even with all this knowledge, our problems have persisted.
So, what is the answer?<br>
      <br>
Where we failed is in process. The old idea of breaking a project into
phases (designi, code,&nbsp; test, integration) is part of our problem.
If we look at the problems we see design problems and integration
problems throughout the life of some projects. In some cases prototype
code is done before design. We are sometimes forced to do bottom-up
design and sometimes we use top-down design.<br>
      <br>
What we need is a continuous and ongoing design effort that eventually
verifies and tests itself against the coding effort. This is the major
component of our new mind set.<br>
      <br>
The design team are the only group that can access the impact
of changing requirements, design changes, problems, testing,
and performance issues. This is an area that has not been given
adequate
attention on most projects.<br>
      <br>
For small projects by one individual, the same conclusion applies. Any
project or module that can be handled by one coder,requires they wear
two hats. Those hats are system engineer(design) and coder. Both hats
must be worn concurrently.<br>
      <br>
OK, all this has been said before and used on projects,
what's different?<br>
      <br>
What if we actually did system engineering and veiwed it as a major
skill set.&nbsp; That would be different.&nbsp; We could also stop
trying to simplify the job of system engineer and simplify the project
instead.&nbsp; Obviously we have done a poor job of managing complex
software projects.&nbsp; That can only mean we need better management
skills and possibly a new model for software projects.&nbsp; I think
both are needed.<br>
      <br>
Once again the answer is mostly process. Our design (system
engineering)
effort
needs to build a project model and review it continuously. For a single
person project, this may a simple list of tasks and measurements. For
big projects it might be simulations and test stubs. It would include
schedules, and anything used to evaluate progress.<br>
      <br>
The size of the design effort would be based upon the number of
unknowns. The unknowns include things like hiring programmers, new
tools, and possibly changes in the weather.<br>
      <br>
Small projects may spend less than 20% of the effort on design. As the
project size grows, so does the design (system engineering). A large
project may be over 80% system engineering.<br>
      <br>
Another big change in mind-set would be the merging of
system engineering, integration, and evaluation. Often these
are separate
efforts. What folly, asking non designers to integrate and evaluate a
design is usually a disaster. At best it is a costly and slow process.
Many projects ask the programmers to do evaluation once the coding is
done. This approach sometimes works, but would be better as a parallel
process handled by the people who designed the project.<br>
      <br>
There is one hole in our conclusions so far. A poor design team can add
complexity and unknowns to a project and make it fail.The answer is to
develop standards for system-engineers similar to what can be found in
many areas of engineering. We need a job classification called
"software system engineer" and it needs to have basic standards.<br>
      <br>
In summary, we need to stop asking coders to do system design. A few
have the skills for system design, but most do not. We also need to
develop the process and knowledge base for system designers. Some
questions we may want to give our prospective designers are:<br>
      <br>
When does a
project need to use a design language?<br>
How do determine the benefit of
developing a prototype?<br>
How do we measure project complexity?<br>
How can
we develop schedules if dates can not be determined?<br>
How do we split projects into pieces and manage each task?<br>
What are the project goals and how will they be acheived?<br>
      <br>
These are very common questions asked by projects and essential to
success.&nbsp; It is also the area where we are currently failing.<br>
