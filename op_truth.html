      <p>Programming is a complex and relative new science, one
would
expect
it to have a lot of misconceptions and myths. The problem is proving
something is a myth and knowing which ideas to question.&nbsp; Recently
I've heard statements like: "Memory is cheap, size
optimizations are not important". and "Assembly optimization is complex
and it is best to study the AMD and Intel manuals". Both of these
statements give me the willies. They both appear
reasonable on the surface, but there is this nagging feeling something
isn't right. OK, so feelings are not worth much, do we have any facts?</p>
      
      
      <p>Since I write a lot of small utilities, this seemed like
a good
place to begin. First, I timed two sort programs. The standard GNU sort
(quick sort) and the example sort program in AsmIDE. This produced the
following table:</p>
      <br>
      
      <table
 style="width: 40%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
 border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="background-color: rgb(204, 153, 51);" colspan="1"
 rowspan="1">program&nbsp; name <br>
            </td>
            <td style="background-color: rgb(204, 153, 51);" colspan="1"
 rowspan="1"> short sort timing</td>
            <td style="background-color: rgb(204, 153, 51);" colspan="1"
 rowspan="1"> long sort timing<br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>asm sort <br>
            </td>
            <td>172ms <br>
            </td>
            <td> 200ms</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>GNU sort <br>
            </td>
            <td>173ms <br>
            </td>
            <td>231ms</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <br>
      
      
      <p>These are hard facts that anyone can verify. They also
provide
a lot
of information. First we can determine the operating system overhead by
looking at the short-sort times. The short-sort sorts 3 lines and all
the time is essentially due to operating system start up. This includes
loading the program, setting up memory, handling file i/o etc.&nbsp; We
now know the operating system hogs most of the time for
small
utilities. A sort program makes heavy use of the CPU which can be seen
from the long-sort times. This gives us a nice way to compare programs,
and languages. In this case one might assume the assembly program is
about 20 percent faster. Wrong, it is about twice as fast.</p>
      
      
      <p>To compare the two programs, first we need to remove the
operation
system overhead. This leaves the time spent in the program. In this
case we see that the GNU sort used 58ms and the assembly sort about 23.
Humm, I wonder if how many benchmarks make this correction? We are
getting a little off track, back to the question of size optimization.</p>
      
      
      <p>We don't know how much program size impacts these times.
It
appears
the asm program has 1ms less overhead at start up. This could be due to
a slightly smaller size. Not a big number, but what happens if we run
the test immediately after boot (before the cache is filled). Bingo,
both programs run slower and the slightly smaller assembler picks up
another 2ms.</p>
      
      
      <p>How about big programs, would they run even slower
because of
start
up time? Obviously, they would. This was easily verified by running
some programs with only a help message displayed. The times showed a
strong relationship to size.</p>
      
      
      <p>We have just proven utilities that are swapped in and out
of
memory
can be optimized for speed by reducing their size. Seems obvious.. but
what about the statement "memory is cheap and optimizing for size
unimportant". It is probably true for device drivers and compiler
writers, but doesn't fit our test cases very well.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>OK, so how about optimizing using the AMD and Intel
manuals? I
do
know the assembler sort was not optimized and might even be considered
brain dead. About the only optimization was use of the merge sort
algorithm. The disk i/o is terrible. Still, it is twice as fast as the
GNU program. This is a fact,
but
possibly the GNU program requires more time to handle the extra
features it provides? We can't prove much about CPU optimization with
one test case. This is a tough nut, because programmers have different
styles. About all we can do is gather a lot of statistics and see if a
pattern emerges.</p>
      
      
      <p>So.. off I went to gather some statistics. I know that
most
compilers do CPU optimization and I know of one set of programs that do
zero CPU optimization (everything I've written). We also have a few asm
programs optimized for size. The e3 editor and a few others at
Linux-Assembly were available. The windows platform has a lot more, but
for simplicity lets stay with Linux.</p>
      
      
      <p>The results were messy but all the assembly programs were
very
fast,
and the compiler programs went from awful to almost as good. This data
still isn't conclusive, but it does suggest optimizing assembler for
speed isn't always important. Just about anything in assembler beats
optimized compiler code. It also looks like program size often impacts
run
time more that speed optimizations and reading manuals.</p>
      What do you think? <br>
